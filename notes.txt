Problem Statement: You are tasked with creating a JavaScript program that simulates 
a digital library system. The program should allow users to add new books, 
search for books by title or author, and display information about the library's collection.

Task 1: Create a constructor function for the Book object with properties for title,
 author, and pages.

Task 2: Implement a method within the Book object to display book information.

Task 3: Create an array to store book objects and implement functions to add new books 
and search for books by title or author.

Task 4: Create functions that utilize the filter method to filter out books that contain 
more than 100 pages and the map method to add "Title: " and "Author: " to the book's title 
and author properties respectably.
