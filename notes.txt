Problem Statement: You are tasked with creating a JavaScript program that simulates 
a digital library system. The program should allow users to add new books, 
search for books by title or author, and display information about the library's collection.

Task 1: Create a constructor function for the Book object with properties for title,
 author, and pages.

Task 2: Implement a method within the Book object to display book information.

Task 3: Create an array to store book objects and implement functions to add new books 
and search for books by title or author.

Task 4: Create functions that utilize the filter method to filter out books that contain 
more than 100 pages and the map method to add "Title: " and "Author: " to the book's title 
and author properties respectably.

----- Part 2 ----------------------




Task 1: Create a constructor function for the Account object with properties for accountNumber,
 balance, and owner.



Task 2: Implement methods within the Account object to deposit and withdraw funds.




Task 3: Create a method to calculate compound interest based on the balance and specified
 interest rate.








Expected Outcomes:

After completing this assignment, students should be able to create objects using constructor 
functions and manipulate 
their properties and methods in JavaScript.
Students should understand how to perform basic mathematical operations and calculations using
 the Math class.
Students should be able to apply object-oriented principles and mathematical concepts to solve
 real-world problems, such as financial calculations in a banking application.
